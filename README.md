## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized location for all assignments. Each assignment is typically organized in its own folder, complete with source code, documentation, and any required resources. The repository supports collaboration, version control, and code review, making it easy to track progress and improvements over time.

## Repository Structure

A typical structure of the repository is as follows:

```
Assignments/
├── assignment-1/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── solution.ext
│   └── resources/
├── assignment-2/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── solution.ext
│   └── resources/
├── common-resources/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

- `assignment-X/`: Each assignment gets its own folder, named appropriately.
- `README.md` (in each assignment): Contains specific instructions, requirements, and guidelines for that assignment.
- `solution.ext`: The solution file(s) for the assignment (could be `.py`, `.js`, `.txt`, etc.).
- `resources/`: Any supplementary material required for the assignment.
- `common-resources/`: Shared resources or reference material applicable to multiple assignments.
